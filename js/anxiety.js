    arabic: "وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱلْحَيِّ ٱلَّذِى لَا يَمُوتُ ۖ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِهِۦ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِهِۦ بِذُنُوبِ عِبَادِهِۦ خَبِيرًۭا ۝",
    translation: "Put your trust in the Ever-Living, Who never dies, and glorify His praises. Sufficient is He as All-Aware of the sins of His servants. (25:58)",
    tafsir: "And rely on the Ever-living Who dies not...: That is: Take God as your guardian concerning their affair; He shall judge amongst them as He wills, and treat them as He sees fit. Indeed, He is a Guardian over them and over all things. This is meant to explain and justify the verse's command to rely on God. The implied argument is: Given that He is the Ever-living Who never dies, nothing can escape from Him and He does not miss anything. It thus follows that He can be relied upon. Glorify Him with praise...: Declare God's purity, clearness and exaltedness from weakness, ignorance, and any imperfection that does not befit His Sacred Precinct. Couple that with praise for His excellence. Sufficient is He as being aware of the sins of His servants: This statement proves God's unity in His actions and attributes. He is the sole authority Who manages the affairs of His servants and judges among them."

    arabic: "لَا يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ٱكْتَسَبَتْ ۗ رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَآ إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَآ إِصْرًۭا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِۦ ۖ وَٱعْفُ عَنَّا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَآ ۚ أَنتَ مَوْلَىٰنَا فَٱنصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ ۝",
    translation: "Allah does not impose upon any soul more than what it can afford... So grant us victory over the disbelieving people. (2:286)",
    tafsir: "The verse describes the divine system: God does not impose upon His servants what is beyond their power. He does not require belief in the incomprehensible, nor tasks that can't be done. It aligns with human nature and reason. The statements are tied together in harmony: God's commands are within human capacity, and His mercy and guidance follow those who submit to them."

    arabic: "وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ وَنَعْلَمُ مَا تُوَسْوِسُ بِهِۦ نَفْسُهُۥ ۖ وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ ٱلْوَرِيدِ ۝",
    translation: "Indeed, We created humankind and know what their souls whisper to them, and We are closer to them than their jugular vein. (50:16)",
    tafsir: "This means that God is nearer to humans than the veins that run through their bodies, especially the jugular vein. It's a metaphor to help people understand divine closeness, though God's true nearness is far more profound. He intervenes between man and his soul, and He knows even its subtlest thoughts."

    arabic: "قُل لَّن يُصِيبَنَآ إِلَّا مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَنَا هُوَ مَوْلَىٰنَا ۚ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۝",
    translation: "Say, 'Never will we be struck except by what Allah has decreed for us; He is our protector.' And upon Allah let the believers rely. (9:51)",
    tafsir: "Only God manages our affairs. He alone has preordained all good and harm. Thus, our responsibility is simply to obey Him and trust Him fully. That is the essence of tawakkul (reliance on God)."

    arabic: "فَإِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا ۝ إِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْرًۭا ۝",
    translation: "For indeed, with hardship comes ease. Indeed, with hardship comes ease. (94:5–6)",
    tafsir: "This verse reassures the Prophet that the burden of his mission, rejection by people, and hardship will be eased. It reflects God's ongoing practice of easing burdens after difficulty. The repetition emphasizes certainty and serves as a universal law: ease always accompanies difficulty."

    arabic: "مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَىٰ ۝ وَلَلْـَٔاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌۭ لَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْأُولَىٰ ۝",
    translation: "Your Lord has not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful of you. And the Hereafter is better for you than the present life. (93:3–4)",
    tafsir: "This verse reassures the Prophet during a time of silence in revelation. God affirms His grace and reminds him that the afterlife holds even greater blessings. It's a divine promise of continued support and ultimate reward."

  {
    arabic: "إِن يَنصُرْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَلَا غَالِبَ لَكُمْ ۖ وَإِن يَخْذُلْكُمْ فَمَن ذَا ٱلَّذِى يَنصُرُكُم مِّنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ ۗ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۝",
    translation: "If Allah assists you, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, who can help you then? So let the believers rely upon Allah. (3:160)",
    tafsir: "The verse calls believers to complete trust in God. If He supports you, you're undefeatable. If He abandons you, no one else can help. Believers are encouraged to rely entirely on God for all their affairs."

  {
    arabic: "وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلًا ۝",
    translation: "And rely upon Allah; sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs. (33:3)",
    tafsir: "God urges reliance upon Him in all matters, especially when the commands of revelation are difficult. His sufficiency is greater than any human or material aid. He is the ultimate means by which all tasks are fulfilled."

  {
    arabic: "يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱسْتَعِينُوا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلصَّـٰبِرِينَ ۝",
    translation: "O you who believe, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient. (2:153)",
    tafsir: "This verse prepares believers for hardship. Patience protects them from despair; prayer redirects their focus to God. Together, these help believers endure and succeed through divine mercy and strength."

    arabic: "أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَهُۥ ۖ وَيُخَوِّفُونَكَ بِٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِۦ ۚ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُۥ مِنْ هَادٍۢ ۝",
    translation: "Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? Yet they threaten you with others besides Him. Whoever Allah leaves to stray will have no guide. (39:36)",
    tafsir: "God asks rhetorically to reassure the Prophet: isn't God enough? Yes, He is. The threats of idolaters are meaningless because Allah alone protects, guides, and suffices His servant. This is a declaration of God's supremacy."
