      arabic: "الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ",
      translation: "Who, when a misfortune befalls them, say: 'Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.' (2:156)",
      tafsir: "There is a 'real' ownership; it is reserved for God, nobody——be a man or something else——shares it with Him. And there is an 'apparent' ownership, for example, man 'owns' his own 'self' as well as his children and properties and so on. But the real ownership is of God, and man owns them in form and appearance only-and that also because God has allowed such attribution. Thus, when man remembers the reality of Divine ownership, and then looks at his own 'self,' he knows that he is wholly and totally owned by God. Then, he realizes that his 'apparent' ownership-of his 'self' as well as of his children and properties, and so on-will soon cease to exist, will become null and void; it will return to his Lord. Then, he will understand that ultimately he owns nothing, either in reality or in appearance. In this background, there is no reason why he should grieve if he is afflicted with some misfortune. One may be affected only by something which one owns-feeling happiness when it is found or sorrow if it is lost. But when he believes that he owns nothing, he shall not be affected by finding it or losing it. How can he be afflicted by any loss when he believes that God is the real Owner of every-thing, and He may manage His property in any way He likes?"

      arabic: "فَلَا تَهِنُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَنتُمُ الْأَعْلَوْنَ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ",
      translation: "So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you shall have the upperhand if you are [true] believers. (3:139)",
      tafsir: " The promise, ‘you shall have the upper hand’, is general and unrestricted, but it is followed by the proviso, ‘if you are believers.’ It therefore gives the following meaning: You should not be weak in your will-power, nor should you grieve for the lost victory, if you are true believers. It is because belief is bound to give you an upper hand over your enemies–belief is accompanied by piety and patience, and these two are the basis of victory and triumph. As for the wound which has afflicted you in this battle, you are not alone in it; the unbelievers too had suffered similar casualties. If you think it over, they have not gained over you in any way. Therefore, you should not feel depressed or grieved."

      arabic: "أَلَا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَاءَ اللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ",
      translation: "Unquestionably, [for] the allies of Allah there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. (10:62)",
      tafsir: "The fact that God says that these believers will indeed have no fear nor will they grieve (10:62) also indicates that what is meant here is a higher level of faith, with which the meaning of servanthood and submission are fully realized in the servant. This is because such a servant sees that all dominion belongs solely to God, without any partner, and that they have no authority over anything, such that they should either fear its loss or grieve over it.This is because fear only arises in the soul when it anticipates harm to itself, and grief occurs when it loses something it loves or when it experiences something it dislikes, or when something brings benefits or harm to it. This does not apply to things that have no connection to the person. A person does not fear for something nor grieve over its loss if it has no connection to them. Hence, the one who sees absolutely everything as falling within the dominion of God and knows that He does not share His dominion with anyone, does not see even themselves as having any claim or right over anything. Therefore, they neither fear nor grieve. This is the characteristic of God's allies when He says, Look! The allies of Allah will indeed have no fear nor will they grieve (Qur'an 10:62). These people do not fear anything nor grieve over anything, neither in this world nor in the Hereafter, except what God wills. God has willed that they fear their Lord and grieve for what they may miss from His honor if they fail to grasp it, and this is all part of submission to God."

      arabic: "إِنَّمَا أَشْكُو بَثِّي وَحُزْنِي إِلَى اللَّهِ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ",
      translation: "[Jacob] said, 'I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you do not know.' (12:86)",
      tafsir: "In Majma' al-bayan, al-Tabrisī writes: 'Bathth refers to a deep distress that one cannot keep to oneself and thus vents or spreads it. Anything that is spread can be expressed with the verb baththa. For example, God says, a and scatters therein (baththa fi-hā) every kind of animal.' Therefore, the use of the verbal noun bathth here is in the sense of the passive participle of the verb or mabthuth, meaning 'that which is spread.' The construction of his saying, 'I complain... only...,' conveys a meaning of exclusivity and implies a limitation of the heart. In other words: 'I do not complain about my suffering and grief to you, my sons and family. If I did, it would have ceased in the shortest time, as is the norm for people when they express their distress and sorrow during calamities. I only complain of my suffer- ing and grief to God, the Exalted. For He is never weary or bored by the pleas of His servants. Those in need continuously beseech Him. I know things about God that you do not. Hence, I do not despair of His solace nor lose hope in His mercy.'When Jacob says: 'I know from Allah what you do not know,' this contains a general indication of the extent of his knowledge of God, which can only be understood in light of the context, as we have highlighted."

      arabic: "إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ",
      translation: "Indeed, those who have said, 'Our Lord is Allah' and then remained on a right course - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. (46:13)",
      tafsir: "Saying Our Lord is God means they affirm and bear witness to the fact that lordship belongs to God alone and that He is the only lord. 'Go aright' That is because a transition (iltifat) means that you turn to address someone else, not the same person. Otherwise this is not a transition. (istaqāmu) means they hold fast to what they bear witness to without deviating or going astray, and they observe the practical requirements of this. ...then they will have no fear, nor will they grieve. This means there is no possible harm or punishment coming for them which they should fear, nor any harm that befalls them in the form of a punishment or terror for which they should grieve. People only fear harm that may come to them and they only grieve for harm they have suffered. Then in then they will have no fear is to suggest a conditional relationship between this and the first part of the verse, in other words: Whoever says 'Our Lord is God' and then goes aright shall have no fear, etc."

      translation: "Praise to Allah, who has removed from us [all] sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative. (35:34)",
      tafsir:"Some exegetes say that the sadness refers to the grief that shadows people due to the trials of life, and that it is removed when they enter heaven; thus, they are praising God for the removal of that grief.There is also a view that sadness refers to a sadness that befalls them after they pass away. It is also said that they are still troubled by the touch of their misdeeds when they enter the eternal garden [and then it is removed]. However, this would be for the person who 'wrongs his own soul' or the 'one who takes a middle course'; those who are foremost in good deeds do not have evils in their book of deeds to suffer for.This view most closely matches what they say: Our Lord is forgiving, gracious"

      arabic: "يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اصْبِرُوا وَصَابِرُوا وَرَابِطُوا وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ",
      translation: "O you who believe! be patient and help eachother in patience and remain stationed and fear Allah that you may be successful. (3:200)",
      tafsir: "The order is unrestricted. The clause, 'be patient', covers every type of patience: Patience in hardships, patience in the obedience of God, and patience against the disobedience of God. However, it refers to an individual's patience, as the next clause shows.al-Muṣābarah translated here as helping each other in patience, liter- ally means vying with one another in being patient. It implies collective patience when individuals bear a common hardship together and each one's patience is augmented by others' steadfastness. In this way, their strength is enhanced, their patience redoubled and its effect multiplied. This phenomenon may easily be experienced, if we first look at an individual as a single person, and then look at his behavior in a group when he becomes a part of a collective whole, each one acting on and reacting towards the others. We shall describe this topic in detail, God willing, in its place....and remain lined up; and fear (the wrath of) Allah, that you may be successful: al-murābaṭah is more comprehensive than al-muṣābarah (vying with one another in patience; helping each other to be patient), because al-murabaṭah' implies people's linking up with one another in their powers, faculties, and activities in all affairs of their religious life- in time of ease as well as in difficulties. As the main aim of these orders is to let the believers attain the reality of happiness of this world and the next otherwise only partial worldly happiness can be achieved which obviously is not the real happiness—these orders have been followed by the words, 'and fear (the wrath of) God, that you may be successful', that is, you may achieve total and real happiness and success"

      translation: "Say, 'Never will we be struck except by what Allah has decreed for us; He is our protector.' And upon Allah let the believers rely. (9:51)",
      tafsir:"In short, it is God alone who looks after our affairs-as shown by the statement, He is our patron, which is phrased in such a way as to indicate exclusivity and we have no say in the matter, nor any control over these apparent causes. On the contrary, the truth is that the affair rests entirely with God and He has afore ordained whatever good or evil and benefit or harm will reach us. This being the case, we should only focus on obeying His commands and striving to uphold His cause. It is God's will that determines whatever good or bad will befall us-God's servants must turn over their affairs to Him, and this is the meaning of trusting in God (tawakkul)."

      arabic: "وَالَّذِينَ جَاهَدُوا فِينَا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَمَعَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ",
      translation: "And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good. (29:69)",
      tafsir: "And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.'We shall surely guide them in Our ways...': God affirms the existence of ways (subul) for Himself and whatever these may be, they all lead to Him, as a way (sabil) is nothing other than a means of reaching that to which it belongs, meaning its destination. Therefore, God's ways are those which bring people closer to Him and guide them towards Him. And insofar as the act of striving is itself a form of guidance, this means that guidance to God's ways is a kind of guidance upon guidance, as God alludes to in the verse: As for those who are guided, He enhances their guidance (47:17).Based on the above, we can see that there is no need to interpret in Us as belonging to an implicit possessive construct to the effect of for Our sake...and Allah is indeed with the virtuous: Some have said God's being with them means in the sense of His assistance and support and this is supported by the fact this phrase appears alongside mention of striving. This is a plausible reading. However, a superior interpretation is that God's being with them is symbolic of His mercy and concern for them, which would implicitly include His assistance and support, as well as many other forms of divine concern which He shows to His virtuous servants out of His infinite mercy and kindness. However, this being with is still more particular than the general sense of being with them by mere virtue of their existence (wujud), which is the import of the verse: ...and He is with you wherever you may be... (57:4)"

      arabic: "يَا أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ ارْجِعِي إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَّرْضِيَّةً فَادْخُلِي فِي عِبَادِي وَادْخُلِي جَنَّتِي",
      translation: "[To the righteous it will be said], 'O soul at peace, return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him], and enter among My [righteous] servants and enter My Paradise.' (89:27–30)",
      tafsir: "The soul at peace is someone who: (1) finds peace with its Lord; (2) is satisfied with what God is satisfied with; (3) sees itself a servant that is not in charge of any good, evil, benefit or loss; (4) views this world as a temporary abode to pass; and (5) realizes that everything in this life-such as wealth, poverty, gain and loss-is a divine test and tribulation. As a result, such a soul is not led into transgression, excess corruption, ascendancy or pride at times of abundance; nor into ungratefulness or disbelief at times of poverty and lack. Rather, the soul is firmly established in servitude, and does not deviate from the straight path to either extreme of excess or deficiency. The person receives this address throughout the entire Day of Resurrection, from when they are raised to life, until when they settle in paradise. In fact, it is applicable from the time of one's death until they enter paradise. Some have said that this call will be made only after the reckoning, but that is not the case. pleased...: There are two elements of being pleased with God: (1) being pleased with His existential and creational decrees (takwīni); (2) being pleased with His legislative and imperative decrees (tashri'i). The for- mer means that one would not be upset with anything that occurs to them. The latter means that one would not be unsettled by the temptation to sin.... and pleasing: Once the servant is pleased with their Lord, their Lord will be pleased with the servant as well, because what dissatisfies God is transgressing the limits of servitude. Hence, when a servant observes the path of servitude, God will certainly be pleased with them. That is why the two qualities are mentioned in this sequence."
